# Contribution Guidelines 

We love to see contributions to the project and have tried to make it easy to do so. If you would like to contribute code to this project you can do so through GitHub by forking the repository and sending a pull request.

Before Comcast merges your code into the project you must sign the [Comcast Contributor License Agreement (CLA)](https://gist.github.com/ComcastOSS/a7b8933dd8e368535378cda25c92d19a).

If you haven't previously signed a Comcast CLA, you'll automatically be asked to when you open a pull request. Alternatively, we can e-mail you a PDF that you can sign and scan back to us. Please send us an e-mail or create a new GitHub issue to request a PDF version of the CLA.
